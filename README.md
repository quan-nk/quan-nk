### Hi there üëã

Hello, I am Quan K Nguyen, a math-built medical graduate, proudly Vietnamese. 

I got my MD at [Hue University of Medicine and Pharmacy]([url](https://www.huemed-univ.edu.vn/)), Hue University (Vietnam); and is currently doing research for a EHR-based cohort study at [College of Health Sciences]([url](https://vinuni.edu.vn/college-of-health-sciences/)), VinUniversity (Hanoi, Vietnam). 

Beside writing blogs, I am interested in using biostatistical methods to study the health patterns and causality. I am starting my career in Biostatistics, aiming to master regression models, stochastic multi-state models, design and analyze clinical trials, and causal methods. Please check out my [Loops]([url](https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/1341250/overview)) and [ORCID]([url](https://orcid.org/my-orcid?orcid=0000-0002-3222-0978)).

I have also joined the [Online Research Club](https://www.onlineresearchclub.org/members) (Nagasaki University, Japan) since 2020 as a Working Group Leader, where assembles a team of roughly 300 young researchers with interests in medicine, infectious diseases, and global health. Our major strength is conducting systematic review with meta-analysis, with many became guidelines in practice. We also utilize a wide range of methodology including observational studies, Delphi methods, diseases modeling, and umbrella reviews.

My main skills: R programming, observational study design and analysis, systematic reviews, heterogeneity in meta-analysis.

I have also been serving with honor as a coordinator and a senior writer and collaborator at the [Y H·ªçc C·ªông ƒê·ªìng]([url](https://yhoccongdong.com/profile/nguyenkhoiquan/)) (Health for the Community) NPO with more than 100 articles written aiming to enhance community health while fighting agaisnt fake news & conspiracy theories in health practice. Back in 2019, we successfully raised a grant called Healing Saigon ($130,000) during COVID-19 shortage to buy essential items and donate them to hospitals (54660 masks, 3170 oxygen mask, 9150 PPE, 3 HFNCs, etc.).
